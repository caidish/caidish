# Hi, I'm Jiaqi Cai — condensed-matter physicist & Pappalardo Fellow at MIT

**Quantum materials × Topology × AI for science.**  
I study exotic phases in low-dimensional systems (FCIs/FQAH, topological superconductivity) and build agentic AI tools that accelerate both experiment and theory.

---

## What I’m working on
- **Exotic topological quantum matter** aimed at computation-changing platforms (anyonics, strongly correlated phases).
- **AI for labs**: agentic systems that read instruments, control microscopes/stages, triage literature, and run analyses end-to-end.  
  > For this mission, **AI is necessary**—to explore vast hypothesis spaces, automate measurement/analysis loops, and close the gap between theory and experiment.

## Active GitHub projects
- **`labAgent`** — an agentic lab-management system for research automation (arXiv triage, tool-use, workflows, CI for science). https://github.com/caidish/labAgent
- **`instrMCP`** — an MCP server for physics instrumentation that lets LLMs connect to (and safely interact with) quantum-device measurement setups.
- **`twoDClassifier`** — an MCP tool that distinguishes 2D materials, a necessary building block for my quantum devices. https://github.com/caidish/twoDClassifier

## On AI capability
The current bottleneck is reasoning. Today’s models are not yet “smart enough” for fully autonomous scientific discovery.  

I’m pushing toward super-AGI-level scientific agents via:
- high-quality data generation,
- robust tool-use policies and safety rails,
- rigorous evaluations and private benchmarks for scientific tasks.

---

## Collaboration interests
- **AI-for-Science** projects (agentic tool-use, planning, evals, safety).
- **Data generation** that actually improves reasoning toward super-AGI.
- **Quantum matters** (2D/moiré, FCIs/FQAH, topological superconductivity).
- **Instrumentation** that microscopes quantum matters and AI at MACRO-, Meso, and nano-scales.
